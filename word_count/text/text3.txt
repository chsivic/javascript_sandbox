For each operand that names a file of a type other
     than directory, ls displays its name as well as any
     requested, associated information.  For each oper-
     and that names a file of type directory, ls dis-
     plays the names of files contained within that
     directory, as well as any requested, associated
     information.

     If no operands are given, the contents of the cur-
     rent directory are displayed.  If more than one op-
     erand is given, non-directory operands are dis-
     played first; directory and non-directory operands
     are sorted separately and in lexicographical order.

     The following options are available:

     -@      Display extended attribute keys and sizes
             in long (-l) output.

     -1      (The numeric digit ``one''.)  Force output
             to be one entry per line.  This is the
             default when output is not to a terminal.

     -A      List all entries except for . and ...
             Always set for the super-user.

     -a      Include directory entries whose names begin
             with a dot (.).

     -B      Force printing of non-printable characters
             (as defined by ctype(3) and current locale
             settings) in file names as \xxx, where xxx
             is the numeric value of the character in
